# ─── VENDORED — copy verbatim into per-image repos ─────────────────
# Lives next to the Dockerfile in every per-image repo so the build
# context can COPY it. Do not edit unless updating the template.
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# inject-certs.sh — drop corp CA certs from /tmp/certs/ into the
# system trust store of a cert-builder stage.
#
# Runs INSIDE the Dockerfile's cert-builder stage (USER root). Idempotent.
#
# Lives at the repo root alongside Dockerfile because the Dockerfile
# does `COPY inject-certs.sh /tmp/inject-certs.sh && RUN /tmp/...`.
# Extracted from the Dockerfile (rather than inlined as a multi-line
# RUN) so SonarQube and shellcheck can scan the bash — both ignore
# code buried inside Dockerfile RUN blocks.
#
# Per-image repos vendor a verbatim copy of this file at THEIR repo
# root. `docker build .` works without any wrapper because the file
# is right there next to the Dockerfile.
#
# Strategy (chicken-and-egg-aware):
#   1. Append the cert PEM directly to the bundle file at
#      /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt AND /etc/ssl/cert.pem.
#      That's what most openssl/curl/wget/etc. consult at TLS-handshake
#      time. Trust becomes instant — no rebuild tool required.
#   2. Copy the cert into the drop-in dir (debian/alpine:
#      /usr/local/share/ca-certificates; rhel: /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/
#      anchors) for tools that c_rehash-walk that directory.
#   3. Optionally run update-ca-certificates / update-ca-trust to
#      regenerate the hashed symlink farm in /etc/ssl/certs/<hash>.0
#      for the small set of tools that look those up. Cosmetic — the
#      cat-append in step 1 is the trust-delivery mechanism.
#
# Scope: the OpenSSL-style bundle only. A Java cacerts keystore, Node's
# compiled-in roots and Python's certifi are separate trust stores —
# nothing here touches them, so an image that reads one of those needs
# its own step in the Dockerfile's fork edits region.
#
# The cat-append-first order is deliberate. Running update-ca-certificates
# (or apk add ca-certificates) FIRST against a TLS-protected internal
# Artifactory mirror deadlocks — the install itself needs the corp CA
# already trusted at handshake time. See sibling cert-builder repo
# (github.com/djlongy/cert-builder) for the same pattern applied to
# pre-baked corp-CA-trusting base images.
